# Simple Click Counter

This repository contains a minimalistic web application designed to demonstrate a basic yet fundamental concept in JavaScript: event handling and DOM manipulation. The project focuses on a single button that, when clicked, increments a counter displayed on the button itself. It serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to understand how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript and how to update the DOM in response to user actions.

## Features

- **Single-Page Application**: A straightforward and user-friendly interface with a single interactive element.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The displayed count updates instantly with each click, showcasing real-time DOM updates.
- **Accessibility**: Designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that it's accessible for users with any level of web development experience.

## How It Works

The application consists of a simple HTML page with a button element. Embedded within the button's label is a `<b>` tag where the click count is displayed. The JavaScript code attached to the page listens for the `click` event on the button. Each time the button is clicked, a counter variable is incremented, and the new value is displayed in the `<b>` tag within the button, giving immediate visual feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the web page and its content.
- CSS (not included in the code but can be easily added): For styling the button and text.
- JavaScript: For implementing the click event handling and dynamic content update.
